# About me
Hi I'm Santina. You can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub. 

# What do I do 

I'm currently a Master student in Bioinformatics. I work at Genome Science Center. My Project is on Latent semantic analysis. 

# What I like doing 

I like doing origami and playing video games. 

I also love playing boardgames. Anyone has any good suggestion? 

My new year resolution is to try to get to know people better and spend more time with friends.
